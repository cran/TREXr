\title{Signal dampening correction}
\usage{
tdm_damp(input, k.threshold = 0.05, make.plot = TRUE, df = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{An \code{\link{is.trex}}-compliant object (\code{zoo} vector, \code{data.frame}) of \eqn{K} values containing
a timestamp and a value column.}

\item{k.threshold}{Numeric, the threshold below which daily maximum \eqn{K} values should not be considered (default = 0.05).}

\item{make.plot}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, a plot is generated presenting the correction curve and the \eqn{K} time series.}

\item{df}{Logical; If \code{TRUE}, output is provided in a \code{data.frame} format
 with a timestamp and a value column. If \code{FALSE}, output
 is provided as a \code{zoo} vector object (default = FALSE).


 @details The function fits a correction curve for signal dampening (e.g., due to wounding)
 according to Peters \emph{et al.} (2018). A sensor specific function is fitted to daily maximum
 \eqn{K} values (considering a minimum cut-off threshold; see \code{k.threshold}). Dependent variables
 for the function include seasonality (DOY) and days since installation (\eqn{t}).
 First, seasonal effects are removed by correcting the \eqn{K} series (residuals; \eqn{Kresid})
 to a second-order polynomial with DOY. These residuals are then used within a
 non-linear model:
 \deqn{K_{resid} = (a + b * t)/(1 + c * t + d * t^{2})}{Kresid = (a + b * t)/(1 + c * t + d * t2)}

 The fitted parameters for \eqn{t} (with \eqn{a}, \eqn{b}, \eqn{c} and \eqn{d}) are used to
 correct \eqn{K} and scale it to the maximum within the first year of installation.
 \strong{Note, that the stability of the fit has to be visually inspected before using the output data}.}
}
\value{
A \code{zoo} object or \code{data.frame} in the appropriate
 format for other functionalities.
 See \code{\link{tdm_dt.max}} output specifications.
 All \eqn{K} values for each method are provided when an \code{\link{is.trex}}-object was used as input.
 If an individual time series was provided for input with \eqn{K} values an alternative output is given:

 \describe{
   \item{k.cor}{corrected \eqn{K} values according to the correction curve.}
   \item{k}{\eqn{K} values provided as input.}
   \item{damp.mod}{\code{data.frame} with the coefficients of the correction curve.}

 }
}
\description{
When long-term \eqn{K} time series (~3 years) are provided, one can perform
 a signal dampening correction (when sensors were not re-installed;
 see Peters \emph{et al.} 2018). Applying the signal dampening
 correction requires  visually inspecting the correction curve
 (see \code{make.plot = TRUE}). The correction curve is constructed with
 the day since installation and the day of year (DOY) to account for seasonal changes in \eqn{K}
 values. The function returns corrected \eqn{K} values and the applied correction curve.
