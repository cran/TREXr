\description{
Returns an example dataset of vapour pressure deficit (\eqn{VPD}) monitoring from
 2012-2015 at 1300 m a.s.l. in the Swiss Alps (Loetschental, Switzerland; Peters \emph{et al.} 2019).
 Sensors were installed at the site on a central tower (~2.5 m above the ground)
 within the canopy to measure air temperature and relative humidity (Onset, USA, U23-002Pro) with a 15-min resolution.
  Vpd (\eqn{kPa} was calculated from the air temperature and relative humidity measurements according to WMO (2008).
